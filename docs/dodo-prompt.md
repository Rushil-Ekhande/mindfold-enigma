Now i am going to implemment the dodo payment system for subsripiton the user would be able to choose from 3 plans - basic, intermidiate and advance.

THese are the plans change the frontend and ui according to these too:

# Basic:
- Write journal entries and reflect for the whole month
- 15 reqests of quick reflect
- 5 requests of deep reflect
- monthly wrap
- Theripist included 2 sessions per week

# Basic:
- Write journal entries and reflect for the whole month
- 25 reqests of quick reflect
- 10 requests of deep reflect
- monthly wrap
- Theripist included 3 sessions per week

# Advance:
- Write journal entries and reflect for the whole month
- 30 reqests of quick reflect
- 15 requests of deep reflect
- monthly wrap
- Theripist included 4 sessions per week


NOw i want you to implement the dodo payments working in the project which would accept payment and all and once the payment is done the supabase's db would be updated too, and then the usage tracking would be done of the user too. so implement all this logic seamlessly and also give what sql to run in supabase too, so that everything would be implemented in one go.
